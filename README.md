# MEng project (Parametric desing of widespan enclosures)
Hi there, welcome to the file repository for my MEng project. This is if you want to get into more detal on how the code looks and what each induvidual section does, as the high level explanations are in the main report. The first folder has all of the Grashopper and oasys files for the iterations and the final product. The second folders has all the connection files and details. 

Below is a list of plugins need for the grasshopper files to work properly. You can install them by using the packagemanager command in Rhino and then typing the relevant name. You can also download any that don't pop up on packagemanger off Food4Rhino (https://www.food4rhino.com/en) and Grasshopperdocs (https://grasshopperdocs.com/).

> - Kangaroo 2 wich should come outomatically downloaded
> -  GH - GSA

To be able to properly run the code, a Rhino licence is needed (comes with a 3 month free trial) and an Oasys licence is needed.

Please enjoy playing around with the code and have fun with Grashopper!!
