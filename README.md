# **MEng Project — Parametric Design of Widespan Enclosures**

Welcome to the file repository for my MEng project **Parametric Design of Widespan Enclosures**.  
This repository contains all files related to the computational workflow and modelling process.  
High-level explanations are available in the main report while this repository focuses on detailed code and scripts.

---

## **Software Requirements**

To run the scripts correctly, you will need:

- A **Rhino 8 or above** licence (3-month free trial available)
- An **Oasys GSA** licence

---

## **Required Plugins**

You can install Grasshopper plugins via the **Rhino Package Manager** (`_PackageManager`).  
If they do not appear there, download them from:

- https://www.food4rhino.com/en  
- https://grasshopperdocs.com/

Required plugins:

- **Kangaroo 2** (usually included with Grasshopper)
- **GH – GSA**

---

## **Repository Structure**

This repository is broken down into two, the **Iteration files** where all the structural iterations in the report are shown and the **Connection files** where all the steel connections designed are shown.
